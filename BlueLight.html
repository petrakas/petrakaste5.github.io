		<h1>What blue light actually is?</h1>
		<p>Blue light is a range of the visible light spectrum. It has wavelenght beetween 400 and 450 nanometers (human eye is typically responding to wavelenghts from 380 to about 740 nm).</p>

		<h2>Bad for eyes?</h2>
		<p>Blue light has more energy per photon of light than any other color in the visible spectrum. That is why there are so many concerns about its effects; blue light is most likely the one to cause damage in various cells of human body when absorbed at high enough doses.
Blue light that comes from computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs, … is not harmful to human eye. The amount of blue light that this screens are giving off is too small to be dangerous.</p>
		
		<p> But that doesn’t mean that blue light (that comes from electronic screens) has no effect on humans.  </p>
		<p> Before the age of artificial lightning, the sun was the only major source of light. People were spending their evenings (and nights) in darkness – they were usually going to sleep when the sun went down and woke up when it came up.		</p>
		<p> Sunlight is still the main source of blue light. Being outdoors during daylight is where most of us get most of our exposure to it (to the blue light). </p>
		<p> The display screens of computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs, other digital devices and all other man-made sources of blue (especially LED lightning) - those are the sources of blue light that are actually the cause of our concerns. Becasue of all this artificail sources of blue light people are not exposed to it only during day, but also during night time. </p>
		<p> Nowadays in almost all parts of the world (exception are some undeveloped countries / regions) evenings are illuminated by artificial lightning. This artificial lightning damadges our body’s biological clock. Every human (every animal too) has a biological clock also called the circadian rhythm. That clock can be ruined and lights at night are doing exactly that – damaging our clocks. </p>
		<p>This circadian rhythm is ruined by the light at nigh, our brain is telling our body that it is still a bright day and we should’t go to sleep. Consequently a lot of people are not getting enough sleep or suffer from insomnia (sleeplessness). </p>
		<p>Sleep deprivation caused by the blue light can potentially be the cause of some diseases, especially in older people. It’s been proven that long term sleep deprivation can be the cause of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, obesity and many other diseases.</p>
